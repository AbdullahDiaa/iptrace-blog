Hello FirstName. Does that feel authentic and genuine to you? Messages and notifications that feel impersonal often don’t entice users to take the action you’d like them to take. Notifications that involve name-based personalization have a much more positive impact, and can actually increase the open rate, engagement, and retention of your audience.

### What Is Name-Based Personalization?

Name-based personalization involves customizing your messages with the first name of each member of your audience. Instead of “hi” or “hello friend”, you can address each individual by name. This gives your messages and notifications a much more sincere feeling.

Customer data may be lacking in some areas, but the first name field has probably been filled out. Some people may not have given you their first name. In the event that you haven’t collected the first name of each member of your audience, having a fallback option of “hi there”, where “there” takes the place of the first name, is a smart choice.

Notifications are one of the best ways to keep your audience updated and engaged. Push notifications have been proven to double a mobile app’s retention rate. Push notifications help keep users engaged and brings them back to your app or website. Personalized push notifications – such as the ones PushBots can help you create – are much more likely to be opened by users – 800% more likely, in fact.

When you use a customer’s name in a push notification, they are much more likely to notice. Those who don’t act on the notification right away are still likely to remember your outreach later when they have time to complete the action. Generic notifications can be easily dismissed and forgotten about, but people may wait to act on personalized notifications until they can set aside time to re-open the app or revisit the website.

Using someone’s name makes your notification feel more authentic and sincere, as though you are messaging them directly rather than blasting a sales message to everyone in your audience. They feel as though the message is specifically tailored for them.

### When and Where to Use Push Notifications

Push notifications can be used for both mobile apps and websites. Push notifications increase engagement, as users are more likely to take the action you suggest in your notification. Whether that is reminding a user to take their cart to checkout, use a discount code while it’s available, or check out new products, messaging your audience with a call to action will remind some users to take that action.

Increased retention is also seen with regular use of push notifications. An app reminding users to reopen the app and take an action – for example, place an order or browse new products – does remind users to check out new stock or complete a checkout. Even if you don’t have a mobile app, push notifications can be implemented on a website, too.

Personalized push notifications can drive user engagement and skyrocket your retention rate. Implement customized messages for your notifications in mobile apps and websites using PushBots mobile push or web push tool.
