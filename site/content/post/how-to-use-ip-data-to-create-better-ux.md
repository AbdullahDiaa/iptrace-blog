Most developers decide to build a web or mobile app for three reasons.



	•	They’ve noticed a gap in the marketplace.

	•	They feel they can provide a valuable service to fill the gap.

	•	They have an idea as to how to provide that service.



But It’s usually only after they get up and running that they’ll start to ask themselves the question that really matters. This question is the most important question any developer can and will ask themselves at any point in their project. And how they answer it is, arguably, the greatest determining factor to whether or not they’ll succeed.



That question is, “do people like using my app?”



UX is what really decides if you sink or swim. It’s what sets industry leaders apart from their competitors and it is how your users will judge you.



And they will judge you.



When you think about how prone people are to experiencing frustration with technology, this should come as no surprise. IP data can take a lot of the guesswork out of giving the people what they want. This, in turn, makes it one of your most powerful tools for growing your popularity.



First off, by using IP data you’ll be able to immediately detect where any one user is located and redirect them to a localized version of your service. That means that you can automatically personalize the content you deliver to your users, and when it comes to UX personalization is king.



In a recent study on the effectiveness of personalized push notifications, companies found that open rates increased by an incredible 800% when sending personalized notifications. In other words, if you really want to make your service appealing to your users you should start by learning a few things about them.



IP data can also help you set yourself apart with its ability to manage digital content. By getting a grip on your media distribution chain, you’ll be able to guarantee that all licensing and copyright agreements are being followed without any of the stress typically associated. Properly disseminating media will also act as a safeguard against online piracy and ensure the safety of digital assets.But your UX isn’t just about the positive experiences you bring to your users, it’s also mitigating negative experiences.



The case for IP data as fraud prevention is pretty clear. The ability to clearly distinguish a user’s geographical location is incredibly beneficial. This allows you to make clear observations as to who are the good IPs and who are the bad IPs. You’ll get fewer false positives and you’ll users will have more confidence in their shopping experience.
